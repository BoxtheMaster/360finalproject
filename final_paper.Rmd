# Introduction

This is introduction.    This is the test for citation. [ see @anderson2015] This is the test for citing figure (See Figure \@ref(fig:gg-oz-plot))

 A few paragraphs which (i) motivate problem importance & relevance
(supported by any pertinent literature), (ii) describe project goals and how such
goals address the problem, (iii) a high-level roadmap of the proposed Bayesian
modeling framework, and (iv) other relevant information for the reader. See project
rubric for details.

```{r gg-oz-plot, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap = "Life expectancy from 1952 - 2007 for Australia. Life expentancy increases steadily except from 1962 to 1969. We can safely say that our life expectancy is higher than it has ever been!"}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Australia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```


# Data

A couple of paragraphs describing the data to be used. You may wish to
discuss: (i) data sources – where are you getting the data? (ii) data description –
what data / variables will be used for modeling? (iii) data type – ordinal discrete,
nominal discrete, continuous, etc., and (iv) data scraping / wrangling – how to
extract and clean data for modeling? See project rubric for details

# Model
$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$
\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

: Discussion & justification of the proposed Bayesian model framework
(prior and sampling model). This discussion should elicit prior information on the
problem, the data sources available, and relevant project goals. Any “downstream”
uses of the model (e.g., for prediction, optimization, ranking) should be discussed
in detail here. See project rubric for details.


This is test for referencing equation. See equation \@ref(eq:binom)

# Results
Posterior analyses from the fitted Bayesian model, and a translation of
such findings into meaningful & understandable conclusions for the target audience
(e.g., engineers, business managers, policy-makers, etc). See project rubric for
details.


# Conclusion
